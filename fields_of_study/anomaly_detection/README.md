# Anomaly Detection 

### Tutorials
- [Spectral Residual](spectral_residual.ipynb): 
  - anomaly detecion for time-series data
  - online detection (almost real-time)
- Autoencoder: 
  - anomaly detection with encoder-decoder deep learning model
  - ANN-based, CNN-based, LSTM-based, etc.
  - for images, time-series, etc.
  - VAE(Variational AE)
- Seq2Seq: 
  - anomaly detection with sequence-to-sequence deep learning model for time-series only.
